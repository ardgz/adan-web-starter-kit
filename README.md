# Adan's Starter Kit

## Purpose
I created my own web development setup to save time on starting new projects.

## Starter Kit Status
Currently still making changes to have a more polished base version. Further changes will be made in the future as I see fit.

## Features
* Packages
  * Libraries
  * Frameworks
* Automated workflow
  * Compiling SCSS files
  * Bundling assets with Webpack
  * Web page reloading

## Setup
1. Run `npm install` inside root directory of project to install included packages
2. Run `gulp` inside project root in command line to run local live server. Saving changes to files while server is running will automatically reload web pages. If configuration files are changed, then the live server must be restarted.
